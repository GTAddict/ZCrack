# ZCrack
This was a zip file cracker that I had written during my Data Structures course to experiment with nodes (each character of a password can be considered to be an independent node, and these nodes are chained together to form a password). It is written in C++ and uses the 7-zip command-line tools. This was one of my first projects and a rather basic one.
